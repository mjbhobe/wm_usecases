mo_dynamic_allocation.py: Dynamic Asset-Allocation Signal (simple regime detector 
    â†’ new weights)

What this does:
Uses SPY (equities) and TLT (long bonds) total-return proxies to estimate a 
risk-on / risk-off regime from rolling volatility & trend, then outputs recommended 
weights (e.g., 70/30 vs 40/60) plus a rationale string you can send to clients.
